# PolyChat
PolyChat is a simple chat application with multiple backends, each written in a different language. I made this to try out and compare a number of different programming languages. Currently the languages include JavaScript with Node.js, Elixir and Go. The end goal of the project is to be able to choose which language to use for a bigger project I'll be doing in the near future.

I'm already fairly familiar with Node.js and I'm mainly including it as a basis for comparison. I haven't used Go or Elixir before this project, so I'm also using this an opportunity to learn the basics of these languages.

## PolyChat Go Backend
This repository contains the Go version of the PolyChat backend. It uses the standard ??? library (I don't currently know, will update when I've figured it out) for the web server and ??? (same as before) for the real-time communication. The backend exposes a number of REST API endpoints, all of which are described in the table below:

| HTTP Method | URL        | Description                     |
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------|
|             |            |                                 |
